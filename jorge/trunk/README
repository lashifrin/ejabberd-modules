About.

It is still under strong development so use it at your own risk.

Licensing.

Bug reporting:
If you found any bug or have any improvement idea you can contact me at (email/xmpp): zbyszek@jabster.pl
Patches are most welcome.

Requirements:
- working ejabberd server with current mod_logdb (compatibile version is bundled with Jorge)
- mod_xmlrpc - for XML-RPC
- mysql5 server
- any http server supporting PHP (5.2.x or higher) with gd, mcrypt and xmlrpc support

Client Requirements:
- Jorge is tested and compatibile with: Firefox 2+ and Opera. (IE support is added from verion of 7, NOTE: IE6 is not supported and not tested - may work anyway)
- Web-browser _must_ have enabled javascript as Jorge strongly relay on jQuery and other js related scripts

Installing:
- setup XML-RPC facility (mod_xmlrpc, available at http://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd-modules/mod_xmlrpc/trunk/)
- copy Jorge files into your http server (sugested vhost over SSL connection). There is sample .htaccess file - showing how to rewrite port 80 to 443
- set up database for Jorge (install/jorge.sql)
- copy config.php.inc to config.php and edit file
- that's it!

Archive usage:
We can say that 1 milion messeges collected by the server consume approx. 65 Megabytes. Depending on number of users that use your server and
how many will activate logging, you must compute db partitions.



!!!SECURITY NOTICE!!!

Before use check if you set registered_globals to off. It is *required* for security reasons!
Jorge is compatibile out of the box with: mod_security2 and php-hardened (suhosin) and easy to chroot.
