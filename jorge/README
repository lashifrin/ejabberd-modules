Jorge by Zbyszek Zolkiewski (C) 2007

About.
 Jorge is set of php scripts that are front-end for Oleg Palij mod_logdb.
It is still under strong development so use it at your own risk.

 Jorge was written as "proof of concept" and can be used as an example: how to build applications for
server-side message archiving, browsing and searching.
However i make lot of effortsment to provide as good quality of code as i can, there can still be plenty of bugs, so
beware of them.

Bug reporting:
If you found any bug or have any improvement idea you can contact me at: zbyszek('at')toliman.pl or via JID: kolargol@jabber.autocom.pl
Patches are most welcome.

Requirements:
- working ejabberd server with current mod_logdb (compatibile version is bundled with Jorge)
- ejabberd backend requirements: postgresql (other backends are not supported)
- mysql server 4.1+ (currently only MySQL backend of mod_logdb is supported)
- any http server supporting php 4.4 (tested only with 4.4.4) with gd, mcrypt,iconv support

Client Requirements:
- Jorge is tested and compatibile with: IE6+,Firefox 2+, Opera (..and Firefox is most recomended)
- Web-browser _must_ have enabled javascript as Jorge strongly relay on jQuery and other js related scripts

Installing:
- copy Jorge files into your http server (sugested vhost over SSL connection). There is sample .htaccess file - showing how to rewrite port 80 to 443
- set up database for Jorge (install/jorge.sql)
- copy config.php.inc to config.php and edit file
- convert mod_logdb database tables (*messages*) into MyISAM and add fulltext indexes. Script for that is provided into install direstory
  edit it and run from console by php convert.php
- patch mod_logdb - it is needed becouse by default mod_logdb use InnoDB engine witch does not support fulltext indexes
- that's it!

Archive usage:
We can say that 1 milion messeges collected by the server consume approx. 65 Megabytes. Depending on number of users that use your server and
how many will activate logging, you must compute db partitions.



!!!SECURITY NOTICE!!!

This scripts was written in enviroment that has registered_globals set to off and it is good practise to leave that setting intact.
Also please note if you have enabled qpc_magic_quotes() as this can break code in some places.
Before use: check your server enviroment thoroughly for potencial security risk.
