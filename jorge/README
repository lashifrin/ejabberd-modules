Jorge by Zbyszek Zolkiewski (C) 2007

About.
 Jorge is set of php scripts/programs that are front-end for Oleg Palij mod_logdb (http://www.dp.uz.gov.ua/o.palij/mod_logdb/)
It is still under strong development so use it at your own risk.

 Jorge was written as "proof of concept" and can be used as an example: how to build applications for
server-side message archivizing, browsing and searching.
However i make lot of effortsment to provide as good quality of code as i can, ther can still be plenty of bugs, so
beware of them.
