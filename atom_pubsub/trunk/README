This module provides ejabberd PubSub data via an AtomPub interface.

# Howto
You need to have the Yaws beams installed and available. It will start in embedded mode, with the `mod_yaws` module (included).
To build, just type `make` and put the resulting beams in some place where ejabberd will find them.

You'll also need to add the module to your ejabberd.cfg in the `mmodules` section:
<pre><code class="erlang">
{mod_yaws,[{logdir, "/tmp/"},
    {servers, [
    {"localhost", 5224, "/opt/var/yaws/www", [
     {dir_listing, true},
     {appmods, {"/atom",     atom_pubsub}}
     ]}
   ]}
  ]}
</code></pre>

# What you get

The AtomPub interface passes the Atom Protocol Exerciser (though some warnings remain).

It means that any AtomPub clients will be able to post to a specific node in your PubSub tree.

It also means that your PubSub tree will also be available as an AtomFeed.

Of course, each time an item is posted through AtomPub or PubSub on a node you are subscribed to, you'll get the notification.

Authentication is required ; you need to authentify (http basic) as a user with the publisher role to be able to post via AtomPub

It expects the payload to be an atom entry, but does not enforce it.

However, it has to be well formed XML.

# Can I have it with OpenFire and Epeios ?
That's not possible. For fetching individual items, there's no way around hitting directly the PubSub mnesia tables.

Code can't be extracted as an XMPP component.

Moreover, it only works with PubSub nodes derived from the default node type. (because of the mnesia tables stuff)

# What's next ?

I did what was minimum to pass the Atom Protocol Exercizer. Still has a few warning.

Adding support for collection and/or binary data would not be hard.

I currently have no plans for actually using the code thus improving it. However, I will review patches you'd send my way for integration.
