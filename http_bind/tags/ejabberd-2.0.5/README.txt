INTRODUCTION
============

This module implements XMPP over Bosh (formerly known as HTTP Binding)
as outlined by XEP-0206[1].
It extends ejabberd's built in HTTP service with a configurable
resource at which this service will be hosted.

This module is included in ejabbed releases since ejabberd 2.0.0
If you downloaded ejabberd from SVN, this module is not included,
so you can install it here.
This module requires an ejabberd 2.0.x
