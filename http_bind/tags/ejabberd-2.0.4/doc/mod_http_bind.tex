This module implements XMPP over Bosh (formerly known as HTTP Binding)
as defined in \xepref{0124} and \xepref{0206}.
It extends ejabberd's built in HTTP service with a configurable
resource at which this service will be hosted.

To use HTTP-Binding, enable the module:
\begin{verbatim}
{modules,
 [
  ...
  {mod_http_bind, []},
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}
and add \verb|http_bind| in the HTTP service. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
{listen, 
 [
  ...
  {5280, ejabberd_http, [
                         http_bind,
                         http_poll,
                         web_admin
                        ]
  },
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}
With this configuration, the module will serve the requests sent to 
\verb|http://example.org:5280/http-bind/|
Remember that this page is not designed to be used by web browsers,
it is used by Jabber clients that support XMPP over Bosh.

If you want to set the service in a different URI path or use a different module, 
you can configure it manually using the option \verb|request_handlers|. 
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
{listen, 
 [
  ...
  {5280, ejabberd_http, [
                         {request_handlers, [{["http-bind"], mod_http_bind}]},
                         http_poll,
                         web_admin
                        ]
  },
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}

The maximum inactivity period is by default 30 seconds.
This can be configured with the module option \term{max\_inactivity}.
For example, to set 50 seconds:
\begin{verbatim}
{modules,
 [
  ...
  {mod_http_bind, [ {max_inactivity, 50} ]},
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}
