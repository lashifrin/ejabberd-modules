This module implements XMPP over Bosh (formerly known as HTTP Binding)
as outlined by \xepref{0206}.
It extends ejabberd's built in HTTP service with a configurable
resource at which this service will be hosted.

To use this module you must enable the module in the modules section:
\begin{verbatim}
{modules,
 [
  ...
  {mod_http_bind, []},
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}
and add it as a request handler in the section about listening ports. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
{listen, 
 [
  ...
  {5280, ejabberd_http, [
                         ...
                         {request_handlers, [{["http-bind"], mod_http_bind}]},
                         ...
                        ]
  },
  ...
]}.
\end{verbatim}
With this configuration, the module will serve the requests sent to 
\verb|http://example.org:5280/http-bind/|
