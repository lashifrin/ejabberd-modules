* To behave somewhat "backward compatible"  with the previous version, pass the option 
  {decode_response,false} to pgsql2:connect, and use only pgsql2:q/2 for queries.

* Note: multiple statment per query are not supported!

* Api docs in pgsql2.erl

Sample session:
{ok,P}=pgsql2:connect(...).
pgsql2:execute_many(P,"insert into test(a,b) values ($1,$2)",[["romeo","Montague"],["juliet","capulet"]]).
pgsql2:q(P,"select a,b from test where a=$1 or b=$2",["romeo","capulet"]).

New, prepared statments:
{ok,P}=pgsql2:connect(...).
pgsql2:prepare(P,"q1", "select * from T where col1 = $1 or col2 = $2 ").
pgsql2:pq(P,"q1",["value1","value2"]).
...
pgsql2:pq(P,"q1",["valueX","valueY"]).
